# Joplin Gen
This is a small tool, written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), using [egui](https://github.com/emilk/egui).  
It's purpose is to generate Markdown files for books from a template and fill it with information to then be used in [Joplin](https://joplinapp.org/) and it's [Hotfolder Plugin](https://github.com/JackGruber/joplin-plugin-hotfolder) so it's then being imported automatically depending on the settings.
